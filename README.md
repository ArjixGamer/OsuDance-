# OsuDance-
OsuDance! is a python based cursor dance bot I created in IDLE. Search for an osu! beatmap, and OsuDance! will find and read the selected beatmap's OSU file, creating mouse movements and clicks matching the map. The project currently has linear movements between hit objects, however, I will be updating this to have the full cursor dance effect. Please do not use this code to hack the game osu!, the code is meant for cursor dancing, and any knowledge of using this code to hack will be reported.
