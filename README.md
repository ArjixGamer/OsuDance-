# OsuDance-
OsuDance! is a python based cursor dance bot I created in IDLE. Search for an osu! beatmap, and OsuDance! will find and read the selected beatmap's OSU file, creating mouse movements and clicks matching the map. The project currently has linear movements between hit objects, however, I will be updating this to have the full cursor dance effect.
